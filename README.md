In this repository, i'm gonna do a simple website with titles, headings and paragraphes, links and images, strong and italic words. I don't learn flexbox in this course, but i will use it anyway, i will do the same with simple CSS, since the course only teached simple HTML, but i studied flexbox and CSS on the web.
